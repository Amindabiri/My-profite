        <h2>EHL 📚</h2>
        <p>I have been at the hotel school since 2020. The EHL (Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne) is a renowned hospitality management school located in Switzerland. It is often referred to as the world's first hospitality school and is known for its high-quality education and training programs in the field of hospitality management.</p>

        <h2>Sport 🏄🪁</h2>
        <p>I go kitesurfing in the summer. 
        Kitesurfing, also known as kiteboarding, is a watersport activity where the participant rides on a specially designed board while being propelled by a large controllable kite. It combines elements of surfing, windsurfing, and paragliding, allowing riders to harness the power of the wind to glide across the water surface and perform various maneuvers such as jumps, tricks, and turns. Kitesurfing can be practiced in various water bodies such as oceans, lakes, and rivers, making it a versatile and exhilarating sport for enthusiasts around the world.</p>

        <h2>Student housing project 🏡</h2>
        <p>I've created Student Rent Apart to help BOSC4 students. Student Rent Apart is a project designed to assist students in BOSC 4 with finding subtenants for their accommodations. Additionally, it facilitates lease takeovers for students in BOSC 6. This initiative aims to streamline the process of subletting and lease transfers, making it easier for students to manage their housing arrangements effectively.</p>
